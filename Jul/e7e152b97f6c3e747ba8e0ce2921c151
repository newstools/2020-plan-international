All children and young people have the right to freely speak out and influence the decisions that shape the world around them. Girls and young women in particular are held back by gender inequalities and oppression that prevent them from being full citizens and leaders. The patriarchal norms and structural barriers at the root of these injustices must be dismantled so that all children and young people can realise their civil and political rights and have their voices count as active drivers of change. Plan international believes that ensuring girls have access to decision-making spaces and can occupy leadership positions at every stage of their lives is key to building a world where girls and women can thrive across politics, the economy and society.

We seek ways to enable vulnerable children to understand and defend their rights. Our goal: Adolescents and youth take collective action for systemic social and political change. In particular, we will support girls and young women to engage politically to shape how decisions are taken; change perceptions on what they are capable of; and together with boys and young men, advance gender equality and young people’s rights. Do you want an equal world? A world where girls and young women, in all their diversity, are seen, heard and valued? Then this toolkit is for you. Now is the time for action!
