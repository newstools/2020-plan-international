Asia is home to more than half of the world’s 1.1 billion girls. Gender inequality in many parts of the region means that girls are often systematically disadvantaged and oppressed by poverty, violence, exclusion and discrimination. Girls’ development is hampered by child, early and forced marriage and high adolescent pregnancy rates. Across the region, gender- based violence against girls and women constitutes a serious and widespread rights violation, particularly with regard to domestic violence, marital rape, and trafficking in women and girls. Written with Save The Children Asia, this thematic policy brief aims to seek and secure commitment from regional and national leaders to urgently prioritize and invest consistently in the protection of girls, who are disproportionately exposed to multitude forms of violence and their devastating consequences. It provides evidence and raises concerns of girls’ vulnerability to combined and complex risks that are further intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Asia is home to more than half of the world’s 1.1 billion girls under the age of 18. The COVID-19 pandemic currently threatens decades-worth of the critical progress made in gender equality and girls’ rights. Girls in the region are facing increasing cases of gender-based violence and child marriage, disruption of education, limited access to sexual and reproductive health services, shrinking employment opportunities, increased psychological distress, and an exacerbated burden of domestic work. We are working to ensure the needs of children, particularly girls, are addressed and not left behind in the response to COVID-19. Our Situation Reports are issued every two weeks highlighting our response in the Asia-Pacific region. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, Plan International CEO Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen reflects on the effects on girls across the globe, and what must be done to mitigate them.
