This research study provides an insight into the girls’ and young women’s activism space in West Africa. There is a dynamic and vibrant culture of girls’ and young women’s activism and organising in West Africa. Yet girls’ and young women’s activism in the region is not well documented and not easy to locate, despite growing interest from development organisations and donors.  Who are these activists, how are they organising, what drives them to demand change and what are the barriers they face? The intention of this research was to begin to answer these questions and identify opportunities for Plan International and others to support and catalyse girl and youth led movements in West and Central Africa. The research is primarily intended to inform Plan International’s regional and country offices in the West and Central African region who are interested in working with and supporting youth and girl activists and their organisations. Learnings are also relevant for likeminded networks, organisations, INGOs and donors who are interested in supporting and multiplying the work of girl and youth activism.
