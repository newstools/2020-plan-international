Across the globe, there are increasing reports of LGBTIQ+ people experiencing COVID-19 related homelessness, food insecurity, health and mental health issues, and violence. COVID-19 relief may not reach LGBTIQ+ communities; for example people who do not have identification cards, who avoid those services due to fear of violence and discrimination, or whose lived experiences and needs are not understood or addressed by relief providers. With many young LGBTIQ+  people forced to isolate in unsafe residences, often with their own families who may not accept their identities, young LGBTIQ+ people are at increased risk of SGBV, other forms of violence and abuse, underlying health conditions and limited access to services, as well as economic vulnerability. In addition, young LGBTIQ+ people and their relatives are often not in a position to seek assistance due to the lack of mobility and social capital, and with little or no access to many social and legal protections. Because of lockdowns and increased social isolation, many informal safety nets are also out of bounds, exacerbating risks for young LGBTIQ+ people. Everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, deserves equal access to opportunities and services and their safety should be protected. Gender inequality and discrimination against girls mean they are often robbed of the right to make their own life decisions - from what happens to their bodies, to when and to whom they marry. Gonzalo shares his top tips on how you can be both a gender equality and LGBTIQ+ ally.
