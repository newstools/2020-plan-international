The theme of this edition of OPENPlan is protection from violence. This issue has a strong focus on gender-based violence and child protection, and the services that exist to support survivors: Every child has the right to feel safe, both at home and at school. Plan International is committed to protecting children from violence and working with the communities, schools and governments who can protect them from harm. Gender-based violence (GBV) stops girls from reaching their potential. We're working to transform attitudes towards girls and women that perpetuate violence against them. This edition of OPENPlan focuses on the impact of gender on skills and opportunities for youth employment and entrepreneurship.
