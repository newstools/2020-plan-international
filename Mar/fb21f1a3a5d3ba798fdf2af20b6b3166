You might have heard that we, girls, are the future. And it’s true. But we’re also the present! We are each unique and wonderful, and we have a lot to contribute to our families, our communities, and to the world in general. We believe that we can change the world, that we have changed the world, and that we are changing the world. Many of us have identified injustices and inequalities – maybe even in our own lives –, and many of us want to do something to change them. This guide is for you, it’s for me, it’s for your friends, it’s for my cousin, it’s for our neighbour. It’s for all the girls that have something to say; girls that want to use their voices to fight against injustices.

This guide is for girls who believe in themselves and in other girls. It’s for girls who care about their rights and the rights of their friends, and that want to fight to defend those rights.
