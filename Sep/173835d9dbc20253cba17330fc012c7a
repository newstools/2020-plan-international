The COVID-19 pandemic may cause 13 million additional child marriages by 2030, and West and Central Africa will be severely affected unless multi-sectoral, comprehensive efforts to end child marriage are accelerated in the region. This joint brief from Girls Not Brides and Plan International outlines the impacts of the pandemic on child marriage. It provides recommendations and an urgent call for action for governments, regional bodies and humanitarian actors to ensure that girls and young women's rights are upheld during and after the COVID-19 crisis response. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated and added yet another layer of vulnerability to girls in the African continent. As countries across Africa experience the impact of COVID-19 across health systems, economies and communities, progress made in the last decade in achieving the rights of adolescent girls’ risks being lost. African governments must act in urgency to address this “invisible crisis “and protect the important gains made to protect, and empower girls over the last decade. This report is for power holders everywhere, including governments and policy makers: we ask you to hear our calls for change and engage with us to co-create this better normal. It is also for girls and young women around the world, as well as our peers, families and communities. We hope this energises you and that you will join us on the journey of co-creating this new reality also!
