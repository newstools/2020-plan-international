This guide has been created for girl and youth led groups working on girls’ rights and contains lots of information on the BPfA, its accountability mechanisms and how you can best use it for your advocacy.   Due to the global situation on COVID-19 lots of events and processes have been postponed and the focus of governments has shifted to responding to the health pandemic. It’s therefore more important than ever to engage with Beijing+25 to make sure that girls’ rights are still a priority of governments, both during this crisis and after. Although everything is changing, there are lots of innovative and exciting ways that girl and youth led groups are coming together to organise on girls’ rights. There are lots of opportunities  for you to organise with other girls, amplify your agenda and to ensure your priorities are heard over the coming months. We hope this guide is useful in supporting you to do so! The global campaign demanding power, freedom and representation for girls and young women. How will Plan International support girls, young women and vulnerable groups? Frequently asked questions about the COVID-19 pandemic.
