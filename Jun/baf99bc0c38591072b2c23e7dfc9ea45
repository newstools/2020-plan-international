The Adolescent Programming Toolkit has been designed to support frontline teams to work with and for adolescents in emergencies and protracted crises. Responding to crises and meeting the unique needs of adolescents, particularly girls, is a core part of Plan International’s work. The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on girls’ and young women’s health, protection, education, economic opportunities and the digital gender divide has once again highlighted the importance of our distinct focus on empowering adolescent girls in crisis settings. The guidance and tools have been developed by Plan International staff working in emergencies and protracted crises based on programme evidence, numerous accounts from adolescents and good practices shared by frontline staff globally. It contains four chapters: Conflict in South Sudan has displaced four million people. Seven million need humanitarian aid. We spoke to girls caught up in the crisis. This report, the first to do so, focuses on the lives and experiences of the adolescent Rohingya girls living in refugee camps in Bangladesh since fleeing conflict in Myanmar. A report on the experiences of adolescent girls caught up in the Lake Chad crisis, and how they respond to the challenges they are facing.
