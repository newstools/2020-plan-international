On top of long-running poverty and malnutrition, in 2019, a record 51 million people are estimated to have been driven from their homes by conflict and disasters, just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. These multiple crises combine with lethal consequences and, in families already struggling to survive, it is girls and young women who are the hardest hit. Zimbabwe and Mozambique are facing an imminent catastrophe as millions of vulnerable people in both countries are now trapped between hunger and coronavirus. Please help us support the most vulnerable children affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence from COVID-19 affected countries and research into girls in other recent crises suggests an impending invisible catastrophe.
