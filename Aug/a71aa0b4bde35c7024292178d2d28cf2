To address the exclusion of all vulnerable children and girls in society, it’s important to understand the unique needs, vulnerabilities and capabilities of young Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Intersex and Questioning/queer people during the COVID-19 outbreak. This infographic highlights some of the issues young LGBTIQ+ people may face during the COVID-19 pandemic. Please see the Plan International briefing paper on young LGBTIQ+ people and COVID-19 for further detail on the challenges faced by young people who are LGBTIQ+ plus recommendations on how we can address these challenges within the pillars of the COVID-19 response. The COVID-19 crisis is posing increasing risks to already vulnerable young LGBTIQ+ people. This briefing paper is for all Plan International staff, to help protect and empower these young people by including them in our response to crises and programme adaptations across the world. Everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, deserves equal access to opportunities and services and their safety should be protected. Gonzalo shares his top tips on how you can be both a gender equality and LGBTIQ+ ally.
