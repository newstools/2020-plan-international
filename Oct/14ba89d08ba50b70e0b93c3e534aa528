In this report, Citi Global Insights and Plan International argue that a comprehensive and fully-costed series of interventions allowing economies to attain 100% upper secondary school completion rates for girls by 2030, could lift GDP in emerging economies by 10% on average compared to a business-as-usual scenario. Leave no one behind. That was the promise made by governments and international civil society in their commitments to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. With less than a decade to go it is clear that, if we continue on our current trajectory, we will fall far short of those goals. Existing research on the economic benefits of investing in girls has taken a siloed approach, focusing largely on individual sectors such as education and health. It has been proven that by investing in these sectors, we can increase economic returns for the individual as well as national GDP. In this report, Citi and Plan International argue that a comprehensive and fully-costed series of interventions allowing economies to attain 100% upper secondary school completion rates for girls by 2030, could lift GDP in emerging economies by 10% on average compared to a business-as-usual scenario. Even greater economic returns would be observed beyond 2030, as the benefits are strongly cumulative. The results are staggering, especially when faced with the consequences of inaction. We directly support millions of girls to get the education they need to transform their lives and the future of their communities. As COVID-19 forces school closures in 185 countries, Plan International and UNESCO warn of the potential for increased drop-out rates which will disproportionately affect adolescent girls.
