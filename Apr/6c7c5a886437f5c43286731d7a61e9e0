At the end of March 2020, some 743 million3 girls are out of school and all over the world reports of domestic violence are already on the rise. Teenage pregnancies are also likely to increase as adolescent girls are sexually exploited and are forced to turn to risky strategies to feed themselves and their families. Plan International has been listening to what girls are saying about the reality of living under lockdown. They are feeling bored, frustrated, alarmed and frightened and they need clear information on the pandemic and support to deal with its impact on them and their families. Research into previous humanitarian crises suggests without urgent action, the long-lasting consequences of COVID-19 for girls worldwide will be abuse, neglect, fear and hunger. We will ensure girls, young women, children and vulnerable groups are protected and supported as the COVID-19 crisis unfolds. The Adolescent Girls in Crisis research is drawn directly from the voices and experiences of girls in three of the world’s most troubled and volatile locations: South Sudan, the Lake Chad Basin and the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.
