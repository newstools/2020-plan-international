The world is facing an unprecedented crisis that has been described as the “greatest public health challenge in a generation”. It has the potential to crumple ordinarily functioning health systems, economies and social networks. As a girls’ rights and humanitarian organisation, Plan International has the responsibility to ensure that the communities we serve – both in our ongoing emergencies and our longer-term development programming – are supported to prepare, prevent and respond to the impacts of COVID-19. Our goal is to contribute to the prevention of the transmission of COVID-19 and reduce the social impact on the most vulnerable communities - particularly in refugee camps, displaced settings, urban slums and sponsorship communities across Plan International programme countries. We will work to ensure that we reduce the social impact on the status of women and girls who are normally disproportionately affected by crises.
