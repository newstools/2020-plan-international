The COVID-19 outbreak will deeply affect the environment in which children and young people grow and develop, from the earliest years to late adolescence. Girls, especially the most marginalised, will be particularly affected by the secondary impacts of the outbreak due to harmful social norms and double discrimination based on age and gender. To meet the needs of girls and to protect them globally our response will be equitable, gender-transformative and protective of human rights.
